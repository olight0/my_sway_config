# for tofi (i use doas in the script you can use sudo if you do not like/use doas by changing the script with a text edtior) you can find a script to install tofi in this repository (:
# NOTE the script is arch only if you want to use the script on non arch/based distros then you need to change the script useing a text edtior
# NOTE i did not make tofi and did not have any involvement with the tofi or the creator/s of it my script is simple just to make the install a bit ez on your side no more no less but if you like to install tofi your self or simple want to take a look you can vist github.com/philj56/tofi it is a real cool project btw
